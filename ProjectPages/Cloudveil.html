        Shine On was an event held by Teton Youth and Family Services in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The events purpose was to raise awareness of mental health in the community. People were able to donate to TYFS as well to help support those struggling with trauma, depression, suicidal thoughts, and more mental health battles. 
        My job was to create the program for the event, so that people could read some more information on the company and know what the event schedule was. My boss had made an invitation using a white and gold marble background, with the accent of forest green. I decided to follow her design so that people knew that it was the same event. I needed to design for 8 pages which included: introduction, the schedule, their services, a call to action, stories, and sponsors. Sticking to the white, gold, and green theme, I created graphics for each page that kept the eye engaged.
